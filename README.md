# lejosRobot-code

Robot project for McGill DPM Class ECSE
1st place robot competition
GOAL: Design an autonomous robot that can navigate on a 12x12 gridlined field where it must be able to locate itself and travel to a desired location while avoiding obstacles.

Uses ultrasonic sensors, light sensors, motors to navigate.
The obstacle avoidance algorithm uses a p-controller algorithm, with moving average, and differential filtering algorithms in Java.
